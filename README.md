# hostel-automation-system
Hostel accommodation during student hood has become unavoidable and managing attendance, grant of leave, checking the genuinity of the request have become challenging without biometric systems Every hostel management is information driven and the information includes the personal details of the students and the leave requisition details from the parents which are usually maintained manually. This increases the paperwork and maintenance of the records becomes tedious. This project system can be used to automate the workflow of leave applications and their approvals in our college. It decreases the paperwork and enables easier record maintenance. It also reduces chances of Data loss.
